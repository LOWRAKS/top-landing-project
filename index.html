      <blockquote>"People often seek to fill a personal void in a number of ways: drugs, sex, rock n' roll, yet fail to realize that, much like ogres and onions, there are layers to their life. Through His Holiness Shrek, we strive to achieve true inner-peace and outer-strength so that we too can fight off a brigade of Farquad's soldiers on 'The Shrekkoning', our judgement day"</blockquote>
